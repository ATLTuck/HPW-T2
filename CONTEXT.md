# Architectural Decisions and Constraints

This document outlines the key architectural decisions and constraints that guided the development of this seed repository.

## Core Principles

1. **Performance First**
   - Minimal runtime overhead
   - Efficient memory usage
   - Optimized network communication
   - Local-first architecture

2. **Security by Design**
   - Encryption at rest and in transit
   - Secure defaults
   - Regular security audits
   - No external service dependencies

3. **Developer Experience**
   - Clear documentation
   - Consistent patterns
   - Easy local development
   - Comprehensive examples

## Technology Choices

### Backend: Go
- **Rationale**: 
  - Excellent performance characteristics
  - Built-in concurrency support
  - Strong standard library
  - Minimal runtime overhead
  - Great tooling support

### Frontend: Svelte
- **Rationale**:
  - Compile-time optimizations
  - Minimal runtime footprint
  - Reactive by default
  - Excellent developer experience
  - Strong TypeScript support

### Databases

1. **SQLite**
   - For transactional data
   - ACID compliance
   - Zero-configuration
   - Perfect for local-first applications

2. **RocksDB**
   - High-throughput key-value storage
   - Excellent write performance
   - Efficient compression
   - Perfect for time-series data

3. **DuckDB**
   - Analytical queries
   - SQL support
   - Columnar storage
   - Perfect for data analysis

## Communication Architecture

### WebSocket Protocol
- Binary protocol for efficiency
- Delta updates to minimize data transfer
- Automatic reconnection
- Fallback to SSE when needed

### Message Queue
- In-memory queue for local development
- NATS for distributed setups
- Message persistence
- Guaranteed delivery

## Security Constraints

1. **Authentication**
   - JWT-based authentication
   - Refresh token rotation
   - Rate limiting
   - IP-based blocking

2. **Encryption**
   - mTLS for all communications
   - AES-256 for data at rest
   - Secure key rotation
   - Environment-based secrets

## Performance Constraints

1. **Latency**
   - WebSocket messages: < 1ms
   - Database queries: < 5ms
   - API responses: < 10ms
   - Initial page load: < 100ms

2. **Scalability**
   - Support for 10,000+ concurrent connections
   - Horizontal scaling without external services
   - Efficient resource utilization
   - Automatic load balancing

## Development Constraints

1. **Local Development**
   - No Docker requirement
   - Native package managers only
   - Minimal setup steps
   - Comprehensive documentation

2. **Testing**
   - Unit tests for all components
   - Integration tests for critical paths
   - Performance benchmarks
   - Security scanning

## Future Considerations

1. **Extensibility**
   - Plugin architecture
   - Custom database adapters
   - Protocol extensions
   - Custom authentication methods

2. **Monitoring**
   - Built-in metrics
   - Performance profiling
   - Error tracking
   - Usage analytics

## Limitations

1. **Known Constraints**
   - Local-first architecture may limit some cloud features
   - Single-node by default (scaling requires additional setup)
   - Limited to supported database types
   - Browser compatibility requirements

2. **Trade-offs**
   - Performance vs. ease of use
   - Security vs. development speed
   - Features vs. complexity
   - Flexibility vs. standardization
